Non-Profit Common Data Model

# Overview
The Non-Profit Common Data Model (CDM) is our version of what it should look like.  We've been working with CRMs, homegrown systems, Excel spreadsheets, Google docs, and many other data sources over the past decade.  We also reivewed the Microsoft https://github.com/Microsoft/Dynamics-365-Industry-Accelerators/tree/master/nfp model and thought we would put our hat in the ring for review.
